# Hi there

My name is Erick Euller Opelt and I'm a software engineer specialized in backend development at [Totvs](https://totvs.com).

I design and develop microservices handling the entire process, from architecture until deploy. I'm mostly used to develop with Java and Spring and using docker and kubernetes for deploying into AWS.

You can contact me on [Linkedin](https://https://www.linkedin.com/in/erick-opelt-394556129/) or send an email to erick@opelt.dev.
