### Installation

First install the latest version of Hugo. In the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) you can find the best way to install the package on your distro. If you are running any debian derivative I'd recommend downloading the .deb package and installing via dpkg.

### Creating a new site

After download you can create a new empty hugo site.

``` sh 
hugo new site blog
```

After running the command above, a new directory called blog will appear in the current directory. Before starting the server to see your site you have to choose a theme.


### Choosing a theme

There are thousands of awesome themes in the hugo [gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to choose from. For this guide we will use the [hello-friend](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend/) theme, the same one that this blog runs on. To add the theme to your site you just need to copy the contents of the theme to the `/themes` folder. The best way to do this is by adding using as a new git submodule, this way you can keep the theme up to date with new features.

```sh 
git submodule add https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git themes/hello-friend
```

By now you already have a full functional site, just navigate into the site folder and run 

```sh
hugo server
```

The command output will point out the server port, it usually is 1313 so just head to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)

### Adding content

All content for the site must be stored in the /content folder as markdown files. If you are creating a blog, the posts should be at the /content/posts folder and have header with the page's metadata information, like the example below:

```
+++
title = "Hugo - From zero to deploy"
date = "2020-02-29"
author = "Erick Euller Opelt"
description = "Test"
+++
```

The template for this header is at the /archetypes folder and can customized at will. Hugo's cli has a helper for creating new content with the header, just type:

```sh
hugo new posts/hello.md
```
 
### Tips for customization

If you want to customize the site style without drastically change the theme you can do so by add ing a css file in the /static folder. For template customization, hugo lets you override the theme partial by creating a new partial with the same name file into layouts/partials.

### Deploy

For deployment we will be using Netlify with 

### Custom domain
